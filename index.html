<h2> Homework #5: Innovative Visualization</h2>
<h3> Ashutosh Dey - adey21@asu.edu - 1217185905</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Marks:
    The Paws represent the the Dogs on each space Mission.
    Each Rocket represents a particular mission on a specific day in a year.
<p>
    Channels:
    Based on if a dog survived the mission the color of the Paw changes.
    Red denotes not survived. Green denotes survived.
<p>
    Interaction:
    No interaction implemented.
<p>
    Source/Inspiration: <a href='http://sxywu.com/filmflowers/' target='_blank'>Film Flowers</a>
    The concept of displaying the years and the respective films has been borrowed for the Film Flowers example.
<p>
    Instead to displaying the flowers, I have displayed the rockets. But the difference is for the Film Flowers example
    <br>
    the number of movies per year is constant, whereas in this visualization the number of missions per year
    <br>
    is not fixed and varies according to the data.
